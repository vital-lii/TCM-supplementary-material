33898179,Biomimetic Liposomal Nanoplatinum for Targeted Cancer Chemophototherapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer is limited by tumor hypoxia. Platinum nanoparticles (nano-Pt) as a catalase-like nanoenzyme can enhance PDT through catalytic oxygen supply. However, the cytotoxic activity of nano-Pt is not comprehensively considered in the existing methods to exert their multifunctional antitumor effects. Here, nano-Pt are loaded into liposomes via reverse phase evaporation. The clinical photosensitizer verteporfin (VP) is loaded in the lipid bilayer to confer PDT activity. Murine macrophage cell membranes are hybridized into the liposomal membrane to confer biomimetic and targeting features. The resulting liposomal system, termed ""nano-Pt/VP@MLipo,"" is investigated for chemophototherapy in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumor models. At the tumor site, oxygen produced by nano-Pt catalyzation improves the VP-mediated PDT, which in turn triggers the release of nano-Pt via membrane permeabilization. The ultrasmall 3-5Â nm nano-Pt enables better penetration in tumors, which is also facilitated by the generated oxygen gas, for enhanced chemotherapy. Chemophototherapy with a single injection of nano-Pt/VP@MLipo and light irradiation inhibits the growth of aggressive 4T1 tumors and their lung metastasis, and prolongs animal survival without overt toxicity.","Animals, Biomimetics, Breast Neoplasms, Female, Liposomes, Metal Nanoparticles, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Platinum",2021,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
37693885,Plant-Derived Exosome-Like Nanovesicles: Current Progress and Prospects.,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, ranging in size from 30-150nm, which can be derived from various types of cells. In recent years, mammalian-derived exosomes have been extensively studied and found to play a crucial role in regulating intercellular communication, thereby influencing the development and progression of numerous diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine has employed plant-based remedies for thousands of years, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that plant-derived exosome-like nanovesicles (PELNs) share similarities with mammalian-derived exosomes in terms of their structure and function. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the study of PELNs and their potential implications for human health. Specifically, we summarize the roles of PELNs in respiratory, digestive, circulatory, and other diseases. Furthermore, we have extensively investigated the potential shortcomings and challenges in current research regarding the mechanism of action, safety, administration routes, isolation and extraction methods, characterization and identification techniques, as well as drug-loading capabilities. Based on these considerations, we propose recommendations for future research directions. Overall, our review highlights the potential of PELNs as a promising area of research, with broad implications for the treatment of human diseases. We anticipate continued interest in this area and hope that our summary of recent findings will stimulate further exploration into the implications of PELNs for human health.","Humans, Animals, Exosomes, Extracellular Vesicles, Cell Communication, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Pulmonary Circulation, Mammals",2023,International journal of nanomedicine
29872621,Biomacromolecules as carriers in drug delivery and tissue engineering.,"Natural biomacromolecules have attracted increased attention as carriers in biomedicine in recent years because of their inherent biochemical and biophysical properties including renewability, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, long blood circulation time and targeting ability. Recent advances in our understanding of the biological functions of natural-origin biomacromolecules and the progress in the study of biological drug carriers indicate that such carriers may have advantages over synthetic material-based carriers in terms of half-life, stability, safety and ease of manufacture. In this review, we give a brief introduction to the biochemical properties of the widely used biomacromolecule-based carriers such as albumin, lipoproteins and polysaccharides. Then examples from the clinic and in recent laboratory development are summarized. Finally the current challenges and future prospects of present biological carriers are discussed.",,2018,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica. B
39236630,Liposomes-enabled cancer chemoimmunotherapy.,"Chemoimmunotherapy is an emerging paradigm in the clinic for treating several malignant diseases, such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and large B-cell lymphoma. However, the efficacy of this strategy is still restricted by serious adverse events and a high therapeutic termination rate, presumably due to the lack of tumor-targeted distribution of both chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents. Targeted drug delivery has the potential to address this issue. Among the most promising nanocarriers in clinical translation, liposomes have drawn great attention in cancer chemoimmunotherapy in recent years. Liposomes-enabled cancer chemoimmunotherapy has made significant progress in clinics, with impressive therapeutic outcomes. This review summarizes the latest preclinical and clinical progress in liposome-enabled cancer chemoimmunotherapy and discusses the challenges and future directions of this field.","Liposomes, Humans, Immunotherapy, Animals, Neoplasms, Drug Delivery Systems, Antineoplastic Agents",2025,Biomaterials
26996620,Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles: a Risk for Human Health?,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a natural oxide of the element titanium with low toxicity, and negligible biological effects. The classification as bio-inert material has given the possibility to normal-sized (>100 nm) titanium dioxide particles (TiO2-NPs) to be extensively used in food products and as ingredients in a wide range of pharmaceutical products and cosmetics, such as sunscreens and toothpastes. Therefore, human exposure may occur through ingestion and dermal penetration, or through inhalation route, during both the manufacturing process and use. In spite of the extensively use of TiO2-NPs, the biological effects and the cellular response mechanisms are still not completely elucidated and thus a deep understanding of the toxicological profile of this compound is required. The main mechanism underlining the toxicity potentially triggered by TiO2-NPs seems to involve the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress, inflammation, genotoxicity, metabolic change and potentially carcinogenesis. The extent and type of cell damage strongly depend on chemical and physical characteristics of TiO2-NPs, including size, crystal structure and photo-activation. In this mini-review, we would like to discuss the latest findings on the adverse effects and on potential human health risks induced by TiO2-NPs exposure.","Cosmetics, Food Safety, Humans, Nanoparticles, Oxidative Stress, Particle Size, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Reactive Oxygen Species, Risk Factors, Titanium",2016,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry
39225412,Ultrasmall Enzyodynamic PANoptosis Nano-Inducers for Ultrasound-Amplified Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy and Lung Metastasis Inhibition.,"Addressing the inefficiency of current therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma is an urgent and pressing challenge. PANoptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, presents a dependable strategy for combating cancer by engaging multiple cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). In this study, an ultrasmall Bi<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> nanozyme with ultrasound-magnified multienzyme-mimicking properties is designed and engineered as a PANoptosis inducer through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species, finally triggering the activation of PANoptosis process. The role of PANoptosis inducer has been verified by the expression of related proteins, including cleaved Caspase 3, NLRP3, N-GSDMD, cleaved Caspase 1, p-MLKL, and RIPK3. The inclusion of external ultrasonic irradiation significantly augments the enzyodynamic therapeutic efficiency. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic efficacy, along with inhibition of lung metastasis, validate the benefits of the Bi<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>-mediated PANoptosis pathway. This study not only elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying Bi<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as a PANoptosis inducer, but also offers a novel perspective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Liver Neoplasms, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Animals, Mice, Cell Line, Tumor, Necroptosis, Reactive Oxygen Species, Ultrasonic Therapy, Ultrasonic Waves, Nanoparticles, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Sulfides",2024,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"
32561255,Pathological effects of nano-sized particles on the respiratory system.,"Recent advances in nanotechnology have made significant progress in biomedical sciences. However, there are growing concerns that exposure to naturally-occurring and synthetic nano-sized particles promotes various types of human diseases. The lungs are the vital organ for gas exchange. Due to their unique position, the lungs can be the primary route that nanoparticles (NPs) enter the human body, which exerts toxic effects. In spite of the wide applications of NPs, the precise effects on health following exposure are not fully understood. To address this, the biophysical properties of naturally-occurring and synthetic NPs, their pathological effects on the respiratory system and the potential human health risk are examined. The goal of this review is to provide the current evidence that exposure to NPs is a risk factor to develop human diseases. The understanding of the pathological process by NPs is essential in preventing and the treatment of nanoparticle-induced human diseases.","Humans, Lung, Nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, Particle Size, Respiratory System",2020,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine"
37393700,Nano delivery system for paclitaxel: Recent advances in cancer theranostics.,"Paclitaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs which processes the obvious curative effect for a broad range of cancers including breast, ovarian, lung, and head & neck cancers. Though some novel paclitaxel-loaded formulations have been developed, the clinical application of the paclitaxel is still limited due to its toxicity and solubility issues. Over the past decades, we have seen rapid advances in applying nanocarriers in paclitaxel delivery systems. The nano-drug delivery systems offer unique advantages in enhancing the aqueous solubility, reducing side effects, increasing permeability, prolonging circulation half-life of paclitaxel. In this review, we summarize recent advances in developing novel paclitaxel-loaded nano delivery systems based on nanocarriers. These nanocarriers show great potentials in overcoming the disadvantages of pure paclitaxel and as a result improving the efficacy.","Humans, Paclitaxel, Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System, Precision Medicine, Drug Delivery Systems, Neoplasms, Nanoparticles, Cell Line, Tumor",2023,"Colloids and surfaces.

36808971,Pulmonary Delivery of Recombinant Human Bleomycin Hydrolase Using Mannose-Modified Hierarchically Porous UiO-66 for Preventing Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"Bleomycins (BLMs) are widely used in clinics as antitumor agents. However, BLM-based chemotherapies often accompany severe pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Human bleomycin hydrolase is a cysteine protease that can convert BLMs into inactive deamido-BLMs. In this study, mannose-modified hierarchically porous UiO-66 (MHP-UiO-66) nanoparticles (NPs) were used to encapsulate the recombinant human bleomycin hydrolase (rhBLMH). When rhBLMH@MHP-UiO-66 was intratracheally instilled into the lungs, the NPs were transported into the epithelial cells, and rhBLMH prevented the lungs from PF during BLM-based chemotherapies. Encapsulation of rhBLMH in the MHP-UiO-66 NPs protects the enzyme from proteolysis in physiological conditions and enhances cellular uptake. In addition, the MHP-UiO-66 NPs significantly enhance the pulmonary accumulation of intratracheally instilled rhBLMH, thus providing more efficient protection of the lungs against BLMs during the chemotherapies.","Humans, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bleomycin, Mannose, Porosity, Lung",2023,ACS applied materials & interfaces
38344832,Emerging Co-Assembled and Sustained Released Natural Medicinal Nanoparticles for Multitarget Therapy of Choroidal Neovascularization.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disease has become a worldwide senile disease, and frequent intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is the mainstream treatment in the clinic, which is associated with sight-threatening complications. Herein, nintedanib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, and lutein, a potent antioxidant, can co-assemble into nanoparticles through multiple noncovalent interactions. Interestingly, the co-assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit significantly improved stability and achieve long-term sustained release of two drugs for at least two months in mice. Interestingly, in rabbit eyeball with a more complete barrier system, the L/N NPs still successfully distribute in the retina and choroid for a month. In the laser-induced mouse choroidal neovascularization model, the L/N NPs after a minimally invasive subconjunctival administration can successfully inhibit angiogenesis and achieve comparable and even better therapeutic results to that of standard intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF. Therefore, the subconjunctival injection of L/N NPs with long-term sustained drug release behavior represents a promising and innovative strategy for AMD treatment. Such minimally invasive administration together with the ability to effectively inhibit angiogenesis reduce inflammation and counteract oxidative stress and holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from this debilitating eye condition.","Animals, Choroidal Neovascularization, Nanoparticles, Rabbits, Delayed-Action Preparations, Mice, Indoles, Angiogenesis Inhibitors, Drug Liberation, Humans, Drug Carriers, Disease Models, Animal",2024,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"
38166847,Traditional Chinese medicine inspired dual-drugs loaded inhalable nano-therapeutics alleviated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by targeting early inflammation and late fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a highly debilitating and fatal chronic lung disease that is difficult to cure clinically. IPF is characterized by a gradual decline in lung function, which leads to respiratory failure and severely affects patient quality of life and survival. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are believed to be important pathological mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of IPF, and the vicious cycle of NOX4-derived ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and p38 MAPK in pulmonary fibrogenesis explains the ineffectiveness of single-target or single-drug interventions. In this study, we combined astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and ligustrazine (LIG) based on the fundamental theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) of ""tonifying qi and activating blood"" and loaded these drugs onto nanoparticles (AS_LIG@PPGC NPs) that were inhalable and could penetrate the mucosal barrier. Our results suggested that inhalation of AS_LIG@PPGC NPs significantly improved bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis by regulating the NOX4-ROS-p38 MAPK and NOX4-NLRP3 pathways to treat and prevent IPF. This study not only demonstrated the superiority, feasibility, and safety of inhalation therapy for IPF intervention but also confirmed that breaking the vicious cycle of ROS and the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising strategy for the successful treatment of IPF. Moreover, this successful nanoplatform is a good example of the integration of TCM and modern medicine.","Humans, NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Inflammasomes, Reactive Oxygen Species, Quality of Life, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Lung, Fibrosis, Inflammation, p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases",2024,Journal of nanobiotechnology
32812291,T-Cell-Mimicking Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer and immune checkpoint blockades, have recently shown considerable success in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, transferred T cells often become exhausted because of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint blockades, in contrast, can reinvigorate the exhausted T cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy is modest in 70-80% of patients. To address some of the challenges faced by the current cancer treatments, here T-cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. Similar to cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors via T-cell-membrane-originated proteins and kill cancer cells by releasing anticancer molecules and inducing Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs are resistant to immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1)) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) of cancer cells by scavenging TGF-Î²1 and PD-L1. Indeed, TCMNPs exhibit higher therapeutic efficacy than an immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, the anti-tumoral actions of TCMNPs are also demonstrated in the treatment of lung cancer in an antigen-nonspecific manner. Taken together, TCMNPs have a potential to improve the current cancer immunotherapy.","Biomimetic Materials, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Immunotherapy, Nanomedicine, Nanoparticles, T-Lymphocytes",2020,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"
36946288,Ultrasound nanomedicine and materdicine.,"The conventional microbubble-based ultrasound biomedicine clinically plays a vital role in providing the dynamic detection of macro and microvasculature and disease theranostics. However, the intrinsic limitation of particle size severely decreases the treatment effectiveness due to their vascular transport characteristics, which promotes the development and application of multifunctional ultrasound-responsive nanomaterials. Herein, we put forward a research field of ""ultrasound nanomedicine and materdicine"", referring to the interdiscipline of ultrasound, nanobiotechnology and materials, which seeks to produce specific biological effects for addressing the challenges faced and dilemma of conventional ultrasound medicine. We comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art scientific advances in the latest progress in constructing ultrasound-based platforms and ultrasound-activated sonosensitizers, ranging from the synthesis strategies, biological functions to ultrasound-triggered therapeutic applications. Ultimately, the unresolved challenges and clinical-translation potentials of ultrasound nanomedicine and materdicine are discussed and prospected in this evolving field.","Nanomedicine, Ultrasonography, Nanostructures, Microbubbles",2023,Journal of materials chemistry.

38865465,Realveolarization with inhalable mucus-penetrating lipid nanoparticles for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in mice.,"The stemness loss-associated dysregeneration of impaired alveolar type 2 epithelial (AT2) cells abolishes the reversible therapy of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We here report an inhalable mucus-penetrating lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for codelivering dual mRNAs, promoting realveolarization via restoring AT2 stemness for IPF treatment. Inhalable LNPs were first formulated with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and our in-house-made ionizable lipids for high-efficiency pulmonary mucus penetration and codelivery of dual messenger RNAs (mRNAs), encoding cytochrome b5 reductase 3 and bone morphogenetic protein 4, respectively. After being inhaled in a bleomycin model, LNPs reverses the mitochondrial dysfunction through ameliorating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis, which inhibits the accelerated senescence of AT2 cells. Concurrently, pathological epithelial remodeling and fibroblast activation induced by impaired AT2 cells are terminated, ultimately prompting alveolar regeneration. Our data demonstrated that the mRNA-LNP system exhibited high protein expression in lung epithelial cells, which markedly extricated the alveolar collapse and prolonged the survival of fibrosis mice, providing a clinically viable strategy against IPF.","Animals, Nanoparticles, Mice, Mucus, Bleomycin, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Alveolar Epithelial Cells, Disease Models, Animal, Administration, Inhalation, Lipids, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Pulmonary Alveoli, RNA, Messenger, Humans, Liposomes",2024,Science advances

39411684,Inhalable and bioactive lipid-nanomedicine based on bergapten for targeted acute lung injury therapy via orchestrating macrophage polarization.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a life-threatening disease closely associated with an imbalance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization. However, current therapeutic strategies for ALI are controversial due to their side effects, restricted administration routes, or poor targeted delivery. The development of herbal medicine has uncovered numerous anti-inflammatory compounds potentially beneficial for ALI therapy. One such compound is the bergapten, a coumarin, which has been isolated from <i>Ficus simplicissima</i> Lour. However, it's been used as an anti-cancer drug and it's effects on ALI remain unexplored. The poor solubility and biodistribution of bergapten heavily limit its application. In this timely report, we developed a bioactive and lung-targeting lipid-nanomedicine by integrating bergapten and DPPC liposome, named as Ber-lipo. A comprehensive series of <i>in vitro</i> experiments confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of Ber-lipo and its protective roles in maintaining the homeostasis of macrophage polarization and epithelial-endothelial integrity. In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model, Ber-lipo can target inflamed lungs and significantly improve lung edema, tissue injury, and pulmonary function, relieve body weight loss, pulmonary permeability, and proinflammatory status, and especially maintain a balance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis showed Ber-lipo's potential in effectively treating inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia, inhibiting proinflammatory signals, and altering the transcriptome of M1/M2 macrophages-associated genes in lung tissues. Molecular docking and Western blot analyses validated that Ber-lipo suppressed the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling axis responsible for ALI progression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that new inhalable nanomedicine (Ber-lipo) can target inflamed lungs and ameliorates ALI by reprogramming macrophage polarization to an anti-inflammatory state via inactivating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB pathway, hence providing a promising strategy for enhanced ALI therapy in the clinic.",,2025,Bioactive materials
35188021,Nanocrystals based pulmonary inhalation delivery system: advance and challenge.,"Pulmonary inhalation administration is an ideal approach to locally treat lung disease and to achieve systemic administration for other diseases. However, the complex nature of the structural characteristics of the lungs often results in the difficulty in the development of lung inhalation preparations. Nanocrystals technology provides a potential formulation strategy for the pulmonary delivery of poorly soluble drugs, owing to the decreased particle size of drug, which is a potential approach to overcome the physiological barrier existing in the lungs and significantly increased bioavailability of drugs. The pulmonary inhalation administration has attracted considerable attentions in recent years. This review discusses the barriers for pulmonary drug delivery and the recent advance of the nanocrystals in pulmonary inhalation delivery. The presence of nanocrystals opens up new prospects for the development of novel pulmonary delivery system. The particle size control, physical instability, potential cytotoxicity, and clearance mechanism of inhaled nanocrystals based formulations are the major considerations in formulation development.","Administration, Inhalation, Cell Survival, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Carriers, Drug Liberation, Drug Stability, Freeze Drying, Lung, Macrophages, Alveolar, Nanoparticles, Particle Size, Pulmonary Surfactants, Solubility, Technology, Pharmaceutical",2022,Drug delivery
38553716,"Novel inhalation therapy in pulmonary fibrosis: principles, applications and prospects.","Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) threatens millions of people worldwide with its irreversible progression. Although the underlying pathogenesis of PF is not fully understood, there is evidence to suggest that the disease can be blocked at various stages. Inhalation therapy has been applied for lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and its application for treating PF is currently under consideration. New techniques in inhalation therapy, such as the application of microparticles and nanoparticles, traditional Chinese medicine monomers, gene therapy, inhibitors, or agonists of signaling pathways, extracellular vesicle interventions, and other specific drugs, are effective in treating PF. However, the safety and effectiveness of these therapeutic techniques are influenced by the properties of inhaled particles, biological and pathological barriers, and the type of inhalation device used. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological, pharmaceutical, technical, preclinical, and clinical experimental aspects of novel inhalation therapy for treating PF and focus on therapeutic methods that significantly improve existing technologies or expand the range of drugs that can be administered via inhalation. Although inhalation therapy for PF has some limitations, the advantages are significant, and further research and innovation about new inhalation techniques and drugs are encouraged.","Humans, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Administration, Inhalation, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, Asthma, Respiratory Therapy",2024,Journal of nanobiotechnology
37432926,Targeted Nanocarriers Co-Opting Pulmonary Intravascular Leukocytes for Drug Delivery to the Injured Brain.,"<i>Ex vivo</i>-loaded white blood cells (WBC) can transfer cargo to pathological foci in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we tested affinity ligand driven <i>in vivo</i> loading of WBC in order to bypass the need for <i>ex vivo</i> WBC manipulation. We used a mouse model of acute brain inflammation caused by local injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±). We intravenously injected nanoparticles targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (anti-ICAM/NP). We found that (A) at 2 h, >20% of anti-ICAM/NP were localized to the lungs; (B) of the anti-ICAM/NP in the lungs >90% were associated with leukocytes; (C) at 6 and 22 h, anti-ICAM/NP pulmonary uptake decreased; (D) anti-ICAM/NP uptake in brain increased up to 5-fold in this time interval, concomitantly with migration of WBCs into the injured brain. Intravital microscopy confirmed transport of anti-ICAM/NP beyond the blood-brain barrier and flow cytometry demonstrated complete association of NP with WBC in the brain (98%). Dexamethasone-loaded anti-ICAM/liposomes abrogated brain edema in this model and promoted anti-inflammatory M2 polarization of macrophages in the brain. <i>In vivo</i> targeted loading of WBC in the intravascular pool may provide advantages of coopting WBC predisposed to natural rapid mobilization from the lungs to the brain, connected directly via conduit vessels.","Mice, Animals, Drug Delivery Systems, Lung, Brain, Liposomes, Leukocytes, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1",2023,ACS nano

An optimized liposome formulation composed of phospholipid, cholesterol and Tween-80 resulted in favorable encapsulation efficiency at 98.06 Â± 0.94%. Homogeneous and stable particle size of 89.6 Â± 7.3 nm and zeta potential of -(87.7 Â± 5.8) mV were determined by laser particle size analyzer. Subsequently, the four-site perfusion rat intestinal model revealed that celastrol-loaded liposomes had improved effective permeability compared to the free drug in four intestinal segments (p < 0.05). Moreover, celastrol-loaded liposomes could also inhibit the tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that liposomes could be a promising perioral carrier for celastrol.","Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Carcinoma, Lewis Lung, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Delivery Systems, Intestinal Absorption, Intestines, Liposomes, Male, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Pentacyclic Triterpenes, Perfusion, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Triterpenes",2011,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)"
33088690,Glycoside scutellarin enhanced CD-MOF anchoring for laryngeal delivery.,"It is essential to develop new carriers for laryngeal drug delivery in light of the lack of therapy in laryngeal related diseases. When the inhalable micron-sized crystals of <i>Î³</i>-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) was utilized as dry powder inhalers (DPIs) carrier with high fine particle fraction (FPF), it was found in this research that the encapsulation of a glycoside compound, namely, scutellarin (SCU) in CD-MOF could significantly enhance its laryngeal deposition. Firstly, SCU loading into CD-MOF was optimized by incubation. Then, a series of characterizations were carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of drug loading. Finally, the laryngeal deposition rate of CD-MOF was 57.72Â Â±Â 2.19% improved by SCU, about two times higher than that of CD-MOF, when it was determined by Next Generation Impactor (NGI) at 65Â L/min. As a proof of concept, pharyngolaryngitis therapeutic agent dexamethasone (DEX) had improved laryngeal deposition after being co-encapsulated with SCU in CD-MOF. The molecular simulation demonstrated the configuration of SCU in CD-MOF and its contribution to the free energy of the SCU@CD-MOF, which defined the enhanced laryngeal anchoring. In conclusion, the glycosides-like SCU could effectively enhance the anchoring of CD-MOF particles to the larynx to facilitate the treatment of laryngeal diseases.",,2020,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

27682265,Biomaterial microarchitecture: a potent regulator of individual cell behavior and multicellular organization.,"Insoluble cues from a cell's surrounding microenvironment have increasingly been shown to be important regulators of cell behavior. The microarchitecture of biomaterials used for 3D cell encapsulation, however, is often underappreciated as an important insoluble factor guiding cell activity. In this review, we illustrate that the subcellular physical features of a scaffold influence a range of cell behaviors, including morphology, cytoskeletal organization, migration, matrix remodeling, and long-range force transmission. We emphasize that the microarchitecture of stromal extracellular matrix (ECM)-specifically the fact that it consists of a network of long interconnecting fibers with micron and nanometer-sized diameters-is an important determinant of how cells naturally interact with their surrounding matrix and each other. Synthetic biomaterials with a microarchitecture similar to stromal ECM can support analogous cellular responses, suggesting that this fibrous microarchitecture is a key regulator of these cell behaviors. Drawing upon examples from in vitro, in silico, and in vivo studies, we compare these behaviors in fibrous matrices to those of cells cultured within nanoporous matrices (e.g., alginate and PEG gels) as well as macroporous scaffolds to highlight key differences in the cellular response to each type of microarchitecture. Understanding how microarchitecture affects cell behavior can lead to more efficient biomaterial selection when designing tissue engineered scaffolds for therapeutic applications.

Interestingly, nanotechnology-based photothermal therapy (PTT) has great potential to overcome these barriers. Previous studies have shown that serum exosomes (hEX) from hyperthermia-treated tumor-bearing mice displayed an array of patient-specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and strong immunoregulatory abilities in promoting dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and maturation. Here, we developed a tumor vaccine (hEX@BP) by encapsulating black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) with exosomes (hEX) against a murine subcutaneous lung cancer model. In comparison with BPQDs alone (BP), hEX@BP demonstrated better long-term PTT performance, greater elevation of tumor temperature and tumor targeting efficacy in vivo. Vaccination with hEX@BP in combination with PTT further demonstrated an outstanding therapeutic efficacy against established lung cancer, and promoted the infiltration of T lymphocytes into the tumor tissue. Our findings demonstrated that hEX@BP might be an innovative cancer photo-nanovaccine that offers effective immuno-PTT against cancers.","Animals, Cancer Vaccines, Dendritic Cells, Exosomes, Humans, Immunotherapy, Mice, Nanoparticles, Phosphorus",2020,Nanoscale
39895155,The Optimized Lipid-Modified Prodrug for CNV Treatment.,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti-neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU-C12, SU-C16, SU-C20, SU-C24, SU-C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU-C12 NPs, SU-C16 NPs, SU-C20 NPs, SU-C24 NPs, SU-C28 NPs. Among these, SU-C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU-C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU-C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).","Prodrugs, Animals, Choroidal Neovascularization, Mice, Lipids, Nanoparticles, Angiogenesis Inhibitors, Humans",2025,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"

The multidrug resistance phenotype is associated with the overexpression of the adenosine triphosphateÂ (ATP)-driven transmembrane efflux pumps in cancer cells. Here, we report a lipid membrane-coated silica-carbonÂ (LSC) hybrid nanoparticle that targets mitochondria through pyruvate, to specifically produce reactive oxygen speciesÂ (ROS) in mitochondria under near-infraredÂ (NIR) laser irradiation. The ROS can oxidize the NADH into NAD<sup>+</sup> to reduce the amount of ATP available for the efflux pumps. The treatment with LSC nanoparticles and NIR laser irradiation also reduces the expression and increases the intracellular distribution of the efflux pumps. Consequently, multidrug-resistant cancer cells lose their multidrug resistance capability for at least 5 days, creating a therapeutic window for chemotherapy. Our in vivo data show that the drug-laden LSC nanoparticles in combination with NIR laser treatment can effectively inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant tumors with no evident systemic toxicity.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1, Adenosine Triphosphate, Antineoplastic Agents, Cell Line, Tumor, Doxorubicin, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Humans, MCF-7 Cells, Mitochondria, NAD, Nanoparticles, Oxidation-Reduction, Reactive Oxygen Species, Silicon Dioxide",2018,Nature communications
38654614,Customized Lanthanide Nanobiohybrids for Noninvasive Precise Phototheranostics of Pulmonary Biofilm Infection.,"A noninvasive strategy for <i>in situ</i> diagnosis and precise treatment of bacterial biofilm infections is highly anticipated but still a great challenge. Currently, no <i>in vivo</i> biofilm-targeted theranostic agent is available. Herein, we fabricated intelligent theranostic alginate lyase (Aly)-NaNdF<sub>4</sub> nanohybrids with a 220 nm sunflower-like structure (NaNdF<sub>4</sub>@DMS-Aly) through an enrichment-encapsulating strategy, which exhibited excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and the second near-infrared (NIR-II) luminescence. Benefiting from the site-specific targeting and biofilm-responsive Aly release from NaNdF<sub>4</sub>@DMS-Aly, we not only enabled noninvasive diagnosis but also realized Aly-photothermal synergistic therapy and real-time evaluation of therapeutic effect in mice models with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilm-induced pulmonary infection. Furthermore, such nanobiohybrids with a sheddable siliceous shell are capable of delaying the NaNdF<sub>4</sub> dissolution and biodegradation upon accomplishing the therapy, which is highly beneficial for the biosafety of theranostic agents.","Biofilms, Animals, Mice, Theranostic Nanomedicine, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lanthanoid Series Elements, Pseudomonas Infections, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Humans, Photothermal Therapy, Mice, Inbred BALB C",2024,ACS nano
34863556,A heme-regulatable chemodynamic nanodrug harnessing transcription factor Bach1 against lung cancer metastasis.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of cancer dominated by metastasis-induced death. The transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) regulates almost all metastasis steps by activating the transcription of critical metastatic genes. It is urgent to engineer a nanodrug enabling regulation of Bach1 against tumor metastasis. Herein, a minimalist nanodrug integrating chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and Bach1 degradation was reported to prevent metastasis of NSCLC. The nanodrug was achieved by self-assembly of ferrocene (Fc) and Tin protoporphyrin IX (TinPPIX). In our nanodrug, Fc not only triggers the production of highly cytotoxic âOH for tumor ablation via Fenton reaction, but also induces heme release from heme-containing proteins to stimulate Bach 1 degradation. Moreover, TinPPIX further augments the free heme level along with amplifies the CDT efficacy by disabling heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-mediated heme conversion into antioxidative bilirubin. The results showed that, compared with control group, TinPPIX/Fc nanodrug caused a four-fold increase in heme level, which triggered remarkable Bach1 degradation in Fbxo22-mediated manner and successfully inhibited Bach1-dominated metastasis. Therefore, this nanodrug could powerfully impeded NSCLC progression and metastasis, offering an innovative heme-regulatable chemodynamic therapeutic approach for lung cancer with strong metastasis capability.","A549 Cells, Animals, Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, F-Box Proteins, Heme, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Mice, SCID, Nanomedicine, Neoplasm Metastasis, Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear, Mice",2022,Journal of colloid and interface science
36466830,Cellular stress modulates severity of the inflammatory response in lungs <i>via</i> cell surface BiP.,"Inflammation is a central pathogenic feature of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19. Previous pathologies such as diabetes, autoimmune or cardiovascular diseases become risk factors for the severe hyperinflammatory syndrome. A common feature among these risk factors is the subclinical presence of cellular stress, a finding that has gained attention after the discovery that BiP (GRP78), a master regulator of stress, participates in the SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Here, we show that BiP serum levels are higher in COVID-19 patients who present certain risk factors. Moreover, early during the infection, BiP levels predict severe pneumonia, supporting the use of BiP as a prognosis biomarker. Using a mouse model of pulmonary inflammation, we observed increased levels of cell surface BiP (cs-BiP) in leukocytes during inflammation. This corresponds with a higher number of neutrophiles, which show naturally high levels of cs-BiP, whereas alveolar macrophages show a higher than usual exposure of BiP in their cell surface. The modulation of cellular stress with the use of a clinically approved drug, 4-PBA, resulted in the amelioration of the lung hyperinflammatory response, supporting the anti-stress therapy as a valid therapeutic strategy for patients developing ARDS. Finally, we identified stress-modulated proteins that shed light into the mechanism underlying the cellular stress-inflammation network in lungs.","Humans, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Inflammation, Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP, Lung",2022,Frontiers in immunology

However, the delivery of BDNF into the brain is not easy as these large protein molecules cannot efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and easily suffer oxidative damage in vivo. Therefore, the quercetin-based alginate nanogels (quercetin nanogels) loaded with BDNF have been developed, which could efficiently bypass the BBB via the nose-to-brain pathway and protect BDNF from oxidative damage, providing an effective route for the therapy of depressive disorders by intranasal delivery.","Rats, Mice, Animals, Quercetin, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Depression, Nanogels, Alginates, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, Antidepressive Agents, Hippocampus, Disease Models, Animal",2023,Journal of nanobiotechnology

To improve its solubility, formulation of baohuoside I-loaded mixed micelles with lecithin and Solutol HS 15 (BLSM) has been performed in this study. We performed a systematic comparative evaluation of the antiproliferative effect, cellular uptake, antitumor efficacy, and in vivo tumor targeting of these micelles using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells. Results showed that the obtained micelles have a mean particle size of around 62.54ânm, and the size of micelles was narrowly distributed. With the improved cellular uptake, BLSM displayed a more potent antiproliferative action on A549 cell lines than baohuoside I; half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was 6.31 versus 18.28âÂµg/mL, respectively. The antitumor efficacy test in nude mice showed that BLSM exhibited significantly higher antitumor activity against NSCLC with lesser toxic effects on normal tissues. The imaging study for in vivo targeting demonstrated that the mixed micelles formulation achieved effective and targeted drug delivery. Therefore, BLSM might be a potential antitumor formulation.","A549 Cells, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cell Line, Tumor, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Carriers, Drug Delivery Systems, Flavonoids, Humans, Lecithins, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Micelles, Particle Size, Polyethylene Glycols, Solubility, Stearic Acids, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2016,Drug delivery

Here, micelles formed by a graft copolymer of multiple PEGs modified branched polyethylenimine are used for delivering runt-related transcription factor-1 (RUNX1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siRUNX1) to the lung, aiming to inhibit the myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs. LR-MSC targeting is achieved by functionalizing the micelle surface with an anti-stem-cell antigen-1 antibody fragment (Fab'). Consequently, therapeutic benefits are obtained by successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs in bleomycin-induced PF model mice treated with siRUNX1-loaded micelles. Furthermore, an excellent synergistic effect of PF therapy is achieved for this micelle system loaded siRUNX1 and glioma-associated oncogene homolog-1 (Gli1) small interfering RNA (siGli1), a traditional anti-PF siRNA of glioma-associated oncogene homolog-1. Hence, this work not only provides RUNX1 as a novel PF therapeutic target, but also as a promising dual siRNA-loaded nanocarrier system for the therapy of PF.","RNA, Small Interfering, Animals, Mice, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Micelles, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Cell Differentiation, Polymers, Lung, Bleomycin, Genetic Vectors, Humans",2021,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"

31502904,Toxicological assessment of nanoparticle interactions with the pulmonary system.,"Nanoparticle(NP)-based materials have breakthrough applications in many fields of life, such as in engineering, communications and textiles industries; food and bioenvironmental applications; medicines and cosmetics, etc. Biomedical applications of NPs are very active areas of research with successful translation to pharmaceutical and clinical uses overcoming both pharmaceutical and clinical challenges. Although the attractiveness and enhanced applications of these NPs stem from their exceptional properties at the nanoscale size, i.e. 1-1000<b>Â </b>nm, they exhibit completely different physicochemical profiles and, subsequently, toxicological profiles from their parent bulk materials. Hence, the clinical evaluation and toxicological assessment of NPs interactions within biological systems are continuously evolving to ensure their safety at the nanoscale.

Osteoclast plays an important role in bone resorption and the growth of bone metastases of lung cancer. In order to treat bone metastases of lung cancer, we reported a docetaxel (DTX)-loaded nanoparticle, DTX@AHP, which could target dually at osteoclasts and bone metastatic tumor cells. The in vitro drug release from DTX@AHP exhibited pH and redox responsive characteristics. DTX@AHP displayed high binding affinity with bone matrix. In addition, DTX@AHP significantly inhibited the differentiation of RAW264.7 into osteoclast and effectively inhibited the proliferation of osteoclasts and tumor cells in in-vitro 3D bone metastases model of lung cancer. DTX@AHP could accumulate in bone metastases sites in vivo. Consequently, DTX@AHP not only markedly inhibited the growth of bone metastases of lung cancer but also reduced osteolysis in tumor-bearing mice.

38414528,Natural Products-Based Inhaled Formulations for Treating Pulmonary Diseases.,"Given the unique physiological and pathological characteristics of the lung, the direct, inhalable route is more conducive to pulmonary drug delivery and disease control than traditional systemic drug delivery, significantly circumventing drug loss, off-target effects, systemic and organ toxicity, etc., and is widely regarded as the preferred regimen for pulmonary drug delivery. However, very few lung diseases are currently treated with the preferred inhaled formulations, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension. And there is a lack of appropriate inhaled formulations for other critical lung diseases, such as lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis, due to the fact that the physicochemical properties of the drugs and their pharmacokinetic profiles do not match the physiology of the lung, and conventional inhalation devices are unable to deliver them to the specific parts of the lung. Phytochemicals of natural origin, due to their wide availability and clear safety profile, hold great promise for the preparation of inhalable formulations to improve the current dilemma in the treatment of lung diseases. In particular, the preparation of inhalable formulations based on nano- and microparticulate carriers for drug delivery to deep lung tissues, which overcome the shortcomings of conventional inhalation therapies while targeting the drug activity directly to a specific part of the lung, may be the best approach to change the current dilemma of lung disease treatment. In this review, we discuss recent advances in nano- and micron-carrier-based inhalation formulations for the delivery of natural products for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, which may represent an opportunity for practical clinical translation of natural products.","Humans, Biological Products, Lung Diseases, Drug Delivery Systems, Lung, Administration, Inhalation, Pharmaceutical Preparations",2024,International journal of nanomedicine

Patients with advanced NSCLC are currently being treated with various therapies, including traditional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapy. However, a considerable proportion of advance patients who cannot benefit from them. Consequently, it is essential to identify a novel research target that offers an encouraging perspective. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has emerged as such a target. At present, it is confirmed that activating STING in NSCLC tumor cells can impede the proliferation and metastasis of dormant tumor cells. This review focuses on the role of STING in NSCLC treatment and the factors influencing its activation.

35603964,Autologous Skin Fibroblast-Based PLGA Nanoparticles for Treating Multiorgan Fibrosis.,"Fibrotic diseases remain a substantial health burden with few therapeutic approaches. A hallmark of fibrosis is the aberrant activation and accumulation of myofibroblasts, which is caused by excessive profibrotic cytokines. Conventional anticytokine therapies fail to undergo clinical trials, as simply blocking a single or several antifibrotic cytokines cannot abrogate the profibrotic microenvironment. Here, biomimetic nanoparticles based on autologous skin fibroblasts are customized as decoys to neutralize multiple fibroblast-targeted cytokines. By fusing the skin fibroblast membrane onto poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid cores, these nanoparticles, termed fibroblast membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles (FNPs), are shown to effectively scavenge various profibrotic cytokines, including transforming growth factor-Î², interleukin (IL)-11, IL-13, and IL-17, thereby modulating the profibrotic microenvironment. FNPs are sequentially prepared into multiple formulations for different administration routines. As a proof-of-concept, in three independent animal models with various organ fibrosis (lung fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and heart fibrosis), FNPs effectively reduce the accumulation of myofibroblasts, and the formation of fibrotic tissue, concomitantly restoring organ function and indicating that FNPs are a potential broad-spectrum therapy for fibrosis management.","Animals, Fibroblasts, Fibrosis, Myofibroblasts, Nanoparticles, Transforming Growth Factor beta",2022,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

GA-loaded micelles (GA-M) were simply andrapidly prepared using lecithin/solutol HS15 using a film-dispersion method. PRM and HA were added in sequence to form layer-by-layer self-assembled micelles (HA-PRM-GA-M), in which particle size, zeta potential, particle morphology, drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release were investigated. Surface charge reversal demonstrated that rapid HA detachment exposed PRM, leading to activation of a ""proton sponge"" effect in the hyaluronidase (HAase)-rich tumor microenvironment. Compared with coumarin 6-loaded micelles (C6-M), more efficient intracellular trafficking was observed for HA-PRM-C6-M, which is associated with the endosomal/lysosomal escaping ability of the exposed PRM. In vivo imaging showed increased enrichment of near infrared fluorescent dye (DIR)-loaded HA-PRM-DIR-M at the tumor site, suggesting that HA enhanced the active tumor targeting of GA. Furthermore, HA-PRM-GA-M showed the stronger antitumor activity than GA and GA-M against human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Here, we developed three ligand-coated nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery in lung cancer therapy: phenylboronic acid-modified nanoparticles (PBA-NPs), PBA combined with folic acid (FA-PBA-NPs), and PBA with mannose (MAN-PBA-NPs). In vitro, MAN-PBA-NPs were preferentially internalized by macrophages, whereas FA-PBA-NPs exhibited superior uptake by cancer cells compared to macrophages. Following intratracheal instillation into mice with orthotopic Lewis lung carcinoma tumors, all three nanoparticles showed similar lung retention. However, MAN-PBA-NPs were more prone to interception by lung macrophages, which limited their accumulation in tumor tissues. In contrast, both PBA-NPs and FA-PBA-NPs achieved comparable high tumor accumulation (â?1.3% of the dose). Furthermore, FA-PBA-NPs were internalized by â?0% of cancer cells, significantly more than the 10-18% seen with PBA-NPs or MAN-PBA-NPs. Additionally, FA-PBA-NPs loaded with icaritin effectively inhibited the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, resulting in superior anti-tumor efficacy through targeted cancer cell delivery. Overall, FA-PBA-NPs demonstrated advantageous competitive uptake kinetics by cancer cells compared to macrophages, enhancing tumor targeting and therapeutic outcomes.","Animals, Nanoparticles, Lung Neoplasms, Humans, Folic Acid, Macrophages, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Cell Line, Tumor, Boronic Acids, Drug Delivery Systems, Mannose, RAW 264.7 Cells, Carcinoma, Lewis Lung, Lung",2025,Biomaterials

The literature data obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database showed an increasing worldwide tendency toward respiratory delivery from 1998 to 2020. Keywords analysis suggested that nasal and pulmonary drug delivery are the leading research topics in respiratory delivery. Based on the results of scientometric analysis, the research hotspots mainly included therapy for central nervous systems (CNS) disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, glioblastoma, and epilepsy), tracheal and bronchial or lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and systemic diseases (diabetes and COVID-19). The study of advanced preparations contained nano drug delivery systems of the respiratory route, drug delivery barriers investigation (blood-brain barrier, BBB), and chitosan-based biomaterials for respiratory delivery. These results provided researchers with future research directions related to respiratory delivery.",,2022,Pharmaceutics
39309489,Recent advances to address challenges in extracellular vesicle-based applications for lung cancer.,"Lung cancer, highly prevalent and the leading cause of cancer-related death globally, persists as a significant challenge due to the lack of definitive tumor markers for early diagnosis and personalized therapeutic interventions. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), functioning as natural carriers for intercellular communication, have received increasing attention due to their ability to traverse biological barriers and deliver diverse biological cargoes, including cytosolic proteins, cell surface proteins, microRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, DNA, and lipids. EVs are increasingly recognized as a valuable resource for non-invasive liquid biopsy, as well as drug delivery platforms, and anticancer vaccines for precision medicine in lung cancer. Herein, given the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of tumor-associated EVs for lung cancer, we discuss this topic from a translational standpoint. We delve into the specific roles that EVs play in lung cancer carcinogenesis and offer a particular perspective on how advanced engineering technologies can overcome the current challenges and expedite and/or enhance the translation of EVs from laboratory research to clinical settings.",,2024,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

36153528,Emerging nanotechnology-based therapeutics to combat multidrug-resistant cancer.,"Cancer often develops multidrug resistance (MDR) when cancer cells become resistant to numerous structurally and functionally different chemotherapeutic agents. MDR is considered one of the principal reasons for the failure of many forms of clinical chemotherapy. Several factors are involved in the development of MDR including increased expression of efflux transporters, the tumor microenvironment, changes in molecular targets and the activity of cancer stem cells. Recently, researchers have designed and developed a number of small molecule inhibitors and derivatives of natural compounds to overcome various mechanisms of clinical MDR. Unfortunately, most of the chemosensitizing approaches have failed in clinical trials due to non-specific interactions and adverse side effects at pharmacologically effective concentrations. Nanomedicine approaches provide an efficient drug delivery platform to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy and improve therapeutic effectiveness. Multifunctional nanomaterials have been found to facilitate drug delivery by improving bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs to overcome MDR. In this review article, we discuss the major factors contributing to MDR and the limitations of existing chemotherapy- and nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems to overcome clinical MDR mechanisms. We critically review recent nanotechnology-based approaches to combat tumor heterogeneity, drug efflux mechanisms, DNA repair and apoptotic machineries to overcome clinical MDR. Recent successful therapies of this nature include liposomal nanoformulations, cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-Carbon dots and Cds/ZnS core-shell quantum dots that have been employed for the effective treatment of various cancer sub-types including small cell lung, head and neck and breast cancers.","Antineoplastic Agents, Carbon, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Humans, Nanotechnology, Neoplasms, Tumor Microenvironment",2022,Journal of nanobiotechnology
38306647,Efferocytosis-Inspired Biomimetic Nanoplatform for Targeted Acute Lung Injury Therapy.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious inflammatory disease that causes impairment of pulmonary function. Phenotypic modulation of macrophage in the lung using fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may be a potential strategy to alleviate lung inflammation. Consequently, achieving specific delivery of FGF21 to the inflamed lung and subsequent efficient FGF21 internalization by macrophages within the lung becomes critical for effective ALI treatment. Here, an apoptotic cell membrane-coated zirconium-based metal-organic framework UiO-66 is reported for precise pulmonary delivery of FGF21 (ACM@U-FGF21) whose design is inspired by the process of efferocytosis. ACM@U-FGF21 with apoptotic signals is recognized and internalized by phagocytes in the blood and macrophages in the lung, and then the intracellular ACM@U-FGF21 can inhibit the excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells to relieve the inflammation. Utilizing the homologous targeting properties inherited from the source cells and the spontaneous recruitment of immune cells to inflammatory sites, ACM@U-FGF21 can accumulate preferentially in the lung after injection. The results prove that ACM@U-FGF21 effectively reduces inflammatory damage to the lung by modulating lung macrophage polarization and suppressing the excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated immune cells. This study demonstrates the usefulness of efferocytosis-inspired ACM@U-FGF21 in the treatment of ALI.","Acute Lung Injury, Animals, Mice, Fibroblast Growth Factors, Biomimetic Materials, Phagocytosis, Macrophages, Apoptosis, Metal-Organic Frameworks, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Male, Zirconium, Cytokines, Lung, RAW 264.7 Cells, Humans, Nanoparticles",2024,Advanced healthcare materials

The cytotoxicity, targeted ligand competition, cell proliferation inhibition, cellular uptake, endocytosis mechanism and target protein suppression of drug-loaded FBqS NPs were evaluated in detail. Compared with several other drug formulations under same condition, siRNA<sup>IGF1R</sup>/DOX/FBqS NPs exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity to A549 cells and the cytotoxicity was competitively inhibited by free folate in dose-dependent manner. The A549 cells treated by siRNA<sup>IGF1R</sup>/DOX/FBqS NPs showed the lowest cell proliferation capacity. The energy-dependent clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis might be the primary cellular uptake mechanism of drug-loaded FBqS NPs. The expression of IGF1R protein in A549 cells treated by siRNA<sup>IGF1R</sup>/FBqS NPs declined dramatically. So the FBqS NPs were expected as the co-carrier system of chemotherapeutants and siRNAs for future clinical application.","A549 Cells, Antineoplastic Agents, Biotin, Cell Survival, Doxorubicin, Drug Carriers, Drug Synergism, Endocytosis, Folic Acid, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Nanoparticles, Particle Size, RNA, Small Interfering, Starch",2019,Drug delivery
36895553,Self-assembled nanoparticles: A new platform for revolutionizing therapeutic cancer vaccines.,"Cancer vaccines have had some success in the past decade. Based on in-depth analysis of tumor antigen genomics, many therapeutic vaccines have already entered clinical trials for multiple cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which have demonstrated impressive tumor immunogenicity and antitumor activity. Recently, vaccines based on self-assembled nanoparticles are being actively developed as cancer treatment, and their feasibility has been confirmed in both mice and humans. In this review, we summarize recent therapeutic cancer vaccines based on self-assembled nanoparticles. We describe the basic ingredients for self-assembled nanoparticles, and how they enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We also discuss the novel design method for self-assembled nanoparticles that pose as a promising delivery platform for cancer vaccines, and the potential in combination with multiple therapeutic approaches.","Humans, Animals, Mice, Cancer Vaccines, Nanoparticles, Melanoma, Lung Neoplasms, Antigens, Neoplasm",2023,Frontiers in immunology
33049807,A review on chitosan and its development as pulmonary particulate anti-infective and anti-cancer drug carriers.,"Chitosan, as a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer, is characterized by anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties. It lately has received a widespread interest for use as the pulmonary particulate backbone materials of drug carrier for the treatment of infectious disease and cancer. The success of chitosan as pulmonary particulate drug carrier is a critical interplay of their mucoadhesive, permeation enhancement and site/cell-specific attributes. In the case of nanocarriers, various microencapsulation and micro-nano blending systems have been devised to equip them with an appropriate aerodynamic character to enable efficient pulmonary aerosolization and inhalation. The late COVID-19 infection is met with acute respiratory distress syndrome and cancer. Chitosan and its derivatives are found useful in combating HCoV and cancer as a function of their molecular weight, substituent type and its degree of substitution. The interest in chitosan is expected to rise in the next decade from the perspectives of drug delivery in combination with its therapeutic performance.","Anti-Infective Agents, Antineoplastic Agents, Betacoronavirus, Biocompatible Materials, COVID-19, Cell Survival, Chitosan, Coronavirus Infections, Drug Carriers, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Pandemics, Pneumonia, Viral, SARS-CoV-2",2020,Carbohydrate polymers
35804252,Particle Design and Inhalation Delivery of Iodine for Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Therapy.,"Diseases caused by upper respiratory tract (URT) and pulmonary infections have been a serious threat to human health for millennia and lack of targeted effective therapeutic techniques. In this study, two kinds of cyclodextrin particles with typical particle shapes of nanocubes and microbars were synthesized through a facile process. Subsequently, the particles were used as carriers for loading and stabilizing iodine and characterizations were performed to demonstrate the loading mechanism. Next-generation impactor (NGI) experiments showed that iodine-loaded microbars (I<sub>2</sub>@microbars) had a deposition rate of 79.75% in URT, while iodine-loaded nanocubes (I<sub>2</sub>@nanocubes) were delivered to the deep lungs with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 46.30%. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) indicated that the iodine-loaded nanocubes and microbars had similar bactericidal effect to povidone iodine solution. Cell viability studies and extracellular pro-inflammatory factor (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6) evaluations demonstrate noncytotoxic effects of the blank carriers and anti-inflammatory effects of iodine-loaded samples. The irritation of the rat pharynx by I<sub>2</sub>@microbars was evaluated for the behavioral observations, body weight changes, histopathological studies, and TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 levels in pharyngeal tissues. The results showed that I<sub>2</sub>@microbars had no irritation to rat pharyngeal tissues at therapeutic doses. In conclusion, the present study provides novel treatment of URT infections via supramolecular cyclodextrin carriers for URT local therapy with iodine loading by a solvent-free method, which enhances the stability and reduces the inherent irritation without inhibiting their antimicrobial effects. Two kinds of cyclodextrin particles with typical shapes of microbars and nanocubes were synthesized by a facile process. Subsequently, iodine was successfully loaded into the particles by gas-solid interaction. The iodine-loaded microbars showed air dynamics characteristics for inhalation delivery to the upper respiratory tract with little alveolar deposition in the lungs.","Administration, Inhalation, Animals, Cyclodextrins, Interleukin-6, Iodine, Particle Size, Pneumonia, Rats, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2022,AAPS PharmSciTech
36386221,Pharmacologic therapies of ARDS: From natural herb to nanomedicine.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common critical illness in respiratory care units with a huge public health burden. Despite tremendous advances in the prevention and treatment of ARDS, it remains the main cause of intensive care unit (ICU) management, and the mortality rate of ARDS remains unacceptably high. The poor performance of ARDS is closely related to its heterogeneous clinical syndrome caused by complicated pathophysiology. Based on the different pathophysiology phases, drugs, protective mechanical ventilation, conservative fluid therapy, and other treatment have been developed to serve as the ARDS therapeutic methods. In recent years, there has been a rapid development in nanomedicine, in which nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles have been extensively studied in the treatment of ARDS. This study provides an overview of pharmacologic therapies for ARDS, including conventional drugs, natural medicine therapy, and nanomedicine. Particularly, we discuss the unique mechanism and strength of nanomedicine which may provide great promises in treating ARDS in the future.",,2022,Frontiers in pharmacology
38849841,NIR triggered polydopamine coated cerium dioxide nanozyme for ameliorating acute lung injury via enhanced ROS scavenging.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life threatening disease in critically ill patients, and characterized by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory factors levels in the lung. Multiple evidences suggest that nanozyme with diversified catalytic capabilities plays a vital role in this fatal lung injury. At present, we developed a novel class of polydopamine (PDA) coated cerium dioxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanozyme (Ce@P) that acts as the potent ROS scavenger for scavenging intracellular ROS and suppressing inflammatory responses against ALI. Herein, we aimed to identify that Ce@P combining with NIR irradiation could further strengthen its ROS scavenging capacity. Specifically, NIR triggered Ce@P exhibited the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory behaviors in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced macrophages through decreasing the intracellular ROS levels, down-regulating the levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and IL-6, up-regulating the level of antioxidant cytokine (SOD-2), inducing M2 directional polarization (CD206 up-regulation), and increasing the expression level of HSP70. Besides, we performed intravenous (IV) injection of Ce@P in LPS induced ALI rat model, and found that it significantly accumulated in the lung tissue for 6Â h after injection. It was also observed that Ce@Pâ?âNIR presented the superior behaviors of decreasing lung inflammation, alleviating diffuse alveolar damage, as well as promoting lung tissue repair. All in all, it has developed the strategy of using Ce@P combining with NIR irradiation for the synergistic enhanced treatment of ALI, which can serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of ROS derived diseases as well.","Cerium, Animals, Acute Lung Injury, Polymers, Indoles, Reactive Oxygen Species, Rats, Mice, Male, RAW 264.7 Cells, Lung, Antioxidants, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Lipopolysaccharides, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Infrared Rays, Free Radical Scavengers, Nanoparticles, Macrophages, Cytokines",2024,Journal of nanobiotechnology
35869032,"Nanomedicine Strategies for Heating ""Cold"" Ovarian Cancer (OC): Next Evolution in Immunotherapy of OC.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, dramatically improving survival rates of melanoma and lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, immunotherapy is almost ineffective against ovarian cancer (OC) due to its cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). Many traditional medications aimed at remodeling TIM are often associated with severe systemic toxicity, require frequent dosing, and show only modest clinical efficacy. In recent years, emerging nanomedicines have demonstrated extraordinary immunotherapeutic effects for OC by reversing the TIM because the physical and biochemical features of nanomedicines can all be harnessed to obtain optimal and expected tissue distribution and cellular uptake. However, nanomedicines are far from being widely explored in the field of OC immunotherapy due to the lack of appreciation for the professional barriers of nanomedicine and pathology, limiting the horizons of biomedical researchers and materials scientists. Herein, a typical cold tumor-OC is adopted as a paradigm to introduce the classification of TIM, the TIM characteristics of OC, and the advantages of nanomedicines for immunotherapy. Subsequently, current nanomedicines are comprehensively summarized through five general strategies to substantially enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by heating the cold OC. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of this expanding field for improved development of clinical applications are also discussed.","Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial, Female, Heating, Humans, Immunologic Factors, Immunotherapy, Nanomedicine, Ovarian Neoplasms, Tumor Microenvironment",2022,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

30458822,"Inhaled nanomaterials and the respiratory microbiome: clinical, immunological and toxicological perspectives.","Our development and usage of engineered nanomaterials has grown exponentially despite concerns about their unfavourable cardiorespiratory consequence, one that parallels ambient ultrafine particle exposure from vehicle emissions. Most research in the field has so far focused on airway inflammation in response to nanoparticle inhalation, however, little is known about nanoparticle-microbiome interaction in the human airway and the environment. Emerging evidence illustrates that the airway, even in its healthy state, is not sterile. The resident human airway microbiome is further altered in chronic inflammatory respiratory disease however little is known about the impact of nanoparticle inhalation on this airway microbiome. The composition of the airway microbiome, which is involved in the development and progression of respiratory disease is dynamic, adding further complexity to understanding microbiota-host interaction in the lung, particularly in the context of nanoparticle exposure. This article reviews the size-dependent properties of nanomaterials, their body deposition after inhalation and factors that influence their fate. We evaluate what is currently known about nanoparticle-microbiome interactions in the human airway and summarise the known clinical, immunological and toxicological consequences of this relationship. While associations between inhaled ambient ultrafine particles and host immune-inflammatory response are known, the airway and environmental microbiomes likely act as intermediaries and facilitate individual susceptibility to inhaled nanoparticles and toxicants. Characterising the precise interaction between the environment and airway microbiomes, inhaled nanoparticles and the host immune system is therefore critical and will provide insight into mechanisms promoting nanoparticle induced airway damage.","Humans, Immune System, Inhalation Exposure, Microbiota, Nanostructures, Particle Size, Respiratory System, Tissue Distribution",2018,Particle and fibre toxicology
39800241,The (re)emergence of aerosol delivery: Treatment of pulmonary diseases and its clinical challenges.,"Aerosol delivery represents a rapid and non-invasive way to directly reach the lungs while escaping the hepatic first-pass effect. The development of pulmonary drugs for respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, lung infections, pulmonary fibrosis or lung cancer requires an enhanced understanding of the relationships between the natural physiology of the respiratory system and the pathophysiology of these conditions. This knowledge is crucial to better predict and thereby control drug deposition. Moreover, aerosol administration faces several challenges, including the pulmonary tract, immune system, mucociliary clearance, the presence of fluid on the airway surfaces, and, in some cases, bacterial colonisation. Each of them directly influences on the bioavailability of the active molecule. In addition to these challenges, particle size and the device used to administer the treatment are critical factors that can significantly impact the biodistribution of the drugs. Nanoparticles are very promising in the development of new formulations for aerosol drug delivery, as they can be fine-tuned to reach the entire pulmonary tract and overcome the difficulties encountered along the way. However, to properly assess drug delivery, preclinical studies need to be more thorough to efficiently enhance drug delivery.","Aerosols, Humans, Administration, Inhalation, Drug Delivery Systems, Lung Diseases, Animals, Nanoparticles, Lung, Particle Size",2025,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society

For the fabrication of our proposed biosensor, titanium (IV) oxide microparticles were first used, followed by dispersing gold nanoparticles into chitosan and immobilizing them onto a carbon paste electrode (CPE) surface. The developed immunosensor exhibits a much higher biosensing performance in comparison with current methods, when it comes to the detection of ProGRP.

34790250,Correlation between Imaging Features and Pathological Stages of Primary Lung Tumors Based on Nanocontrast Agents.,"As one of the conventional methods of lung cancer detection, computed tomography (CT) usually requires the use of contrast agents to enhance the imaging effect. Conventional iodine contrast agents have poor signal-to-noise ratio and are prone to adverse reactions. It is necessary to find more effective and safe contrast agents for CT scans. The gold nanoparticles with secondary electron effect and photoelectric absorption effect can prolong the display time of the patient's blood circulation after being injected into the patient's body, which makes the nanocontrast agent a research hotspot in the field of CT imaging. In this study, ultrasmall gold nanoclusters with a diameter of about 5ânm were used as the contrast agent in CT scans. It was found that CT scans based on nanocontrast agents can obtain high-quality lung cancer imaging images, and the patient has no obvious adverse reactions. When observing the CT image, it was found that the stage of lung cancer patients can be clearly distinguished through the CT scan image. When analyzing the consistency of CT imaging and pathological classification, the Kappa value was 0.810, indicating that the two have a high degree of consistency. Therefore, this study believes that the imaging characteristics of primary lung tumors based on nanocontrast agents are highly correlated with their pathological types.","Computational Biology, Contrast Media, Gold, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Metal Nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, Neoplasm Staging, Particle Size, Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2021,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine

These factors determine the long-term nature of the effect of iron oxide nanoparticles on the body. However, studies in the field of chronic nanotoxicology of magnetic iron particles are insufficient and scattered. Studies show that toxicity may be increased depending on oral and inhalation routes of administration rather than injection. The sensory nerve pathway can produce a number of specific effects not seen with other routes of administration. Organ systems showing potential toxic effects when injected with iron oxide nanoparticles include the nervous system, heart and lungs, the thyroid gland, and organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). A special place is occupied by the reproductive system and the effect of nanoparticles on the health of the first and second generations of individuals exposed to the toxic effects of iron oxide nanoparticles.

We preconjugated the tumor target peptide luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) to BSA molecules to prepare [(64)Cu]CuNC@BSA-LHRH. The prepared [(64)Cu]Cu nanoclusters showed high radiolabeling stability, ultrasmall size, and rapid deposition and diffusion into tumor, as well as predominantly renal clearance. [(64)Cu]CuNC@BSA-LHRH showed 4 times higher tumor uptake compared with that of [(64)Cu]CuNC@BSA by analyzing the (64)Cu radioactivity of tissues via gamma counting.

Orally administered drugs usually fail to efficiently penetrate the interstitial tissue and reach the lesions, resulting in low treatment efficiency. Luteolin (Lut)Â is a natural flavonoid, active metabolites of which possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-apoptotic properties. In this study, a nano-formulation is developed by loading Lut into hyaluronidase nanoparticles (Lut@HAase). These Lut@HAase nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit small size and good stability, suitable for noninvasive inhalation and accumulation in the lungs, and hyaluronidase at the site of lesions can degrade hyaluronic acid in the interstitial tissue, enabling efficient penetration of Lut. Lut's therapeutic effect, when administered via NPs, is studied both in vitro (using MRC5 cells) and in vivo (using IPF mice models), and its anti-fibrotic properties are found to inhibit inflammation and eliminate reactive oxygen species.

These agents have shown some efficacy for the treatment of heart failure, but the long-term survival rate of patients with heart failure remains low. Additional effective pharmacological approaches are urgently required. Our previous studies have demonstrated that curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from the root of Curcuma longa, prevented the development of heart failure in rat models of myocardial infarction and hypertensive heart disease. However, until recently curcumin's poor water solubility and extremely low bioavailability have presented serious challenges to its clinical applicability. In recent years, highly absorbable curcumin preparations have been developed using methods such as nanoparticle formation and micellization, and there are now high expectations for their wide clinical application. Our group has developed a highly absorbable curcumin formulation called Theracurmin using nanoparticulation and surface processing techniques. Our preliminary data indicated that Theracurmin may improve left ventricular diastolic function. Furthermore, we have already completed and are currently carrying out several clinical trials using Theracurmin against heart failure-related diseases. This paper summarizes and discusses the potential clinical applications of curcumin, focusing on our highly absorbable curcumin formulation, Theracurmin.","Administration, Oral, Animals, Biological Availability, Curcumin, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Compounding, Heart Failure, Humans, Life Style, Nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, Phytotherapy, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, Rats, Solubility",2018,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan
39265826,"Natural pachypodol integrated, lung targeted and inhaled lipid nanomedicine ameliorates acute lung injury via anti-inflammation and repairing lung barrier.","Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a high-mortality disease caused by multiple disorders such as COVID-19, influenza, and sepsis. Current therapies mainly rely on the inhalation of nitric oxide or injection of pharmaceutical drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids); however, their toxicity, side effects, or administration routes limit their clinical application. In this study, pachypodol (Pac), a hydrophobic flavonol with anti-inflammatory effects, was extracted from Pogostemon cablin Benth and intercalated in liposomes (Pac@liposome, Pac-lipo) to improve its solubility, biodistribution, and bioavailability, aiming at enhanced ALI/ARDS therapy. Nanosized Pac-lipo was confirmed to have stable physical properties, good biodistribution, and reliable biocompatibility. In vitro tests proved that Pac-lipo has anti-inflammatory property and protective effects on endothelial and epithelial barriers in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages and endothelial cells, respectively. Further, the roles of Pac-lipo were validated on treating LPS-induced ALI in mice. Pac-lipo showed better effects than did Pac alone on relieving ALI phenotypes: It significantly attenuated lung index, improved pulmonary functions, inhibited cytokine expression such as TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², and iNOS in lung tissues, alleviated lung injury shown by HE staining, reduced protein content and total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and repaired lung epithelial and vascular endothelial barriers. As regards the underlying mechanisms, RNA sequencing results showed that the effects of the drugs were associated with numerous immune- and inflammation-related signaling pathways. Molecular docking and western blotting demonstrated that Pac-lipo inhibited the activation of the TLR4-MyD88-NF-ÎºB/MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, for the first time, our new drug (Pac-lipo) ameliorates ALI via inhibition of TLR4-MyD88-NF-ÎºB/MAPK pathway-mediated inflammation and disruption of lung barrier. These findings may provide a promising strategy for ALI treatment in the clinic.","Animals, Acute Lung Injury, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Liposomes, Lung, Administration, Inhalation, Male, Mice, Humans, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Nanomedicine, Lipopolysaccharides, Lamiaceae, RAW 264.7 Cells, Lipids",2024,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society

36443972,Current Research on Spray-Dried Chitosan Nanocomposite Microparticles for Pulmonary Drug Delivery.,"Using the pulmonary route for systemic and local drug delivery is an attractive method of drug administration because it has a high alveolar surface area, abundant blood flow, a thin airblood barrier, and low metabolic activity. In recent years, the evolution of inhalable chitosan nanocomposite microparticles formulations enabled researchers to develop new pulmonary drug delivery platforms that combine the advantages of microparticles and nanoparticles using a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer with polycationic nature and inherent immunogenicity that enhances cell targeting. Therefore, this review aims to offer an overview of the recent advances in inhalable chitosan nanocomposites microparticles formulated in the previous five years in terms of primary nanoparticles manufacturing methods; namely, ionic crosslinking of chitosan using tripolyphosphate, electrospinning/electrospraying, layer-by-layer deposition, and nanospray drying; final microparticles manufacturing techniques using spray drying, nano spray drying, and supercritical assisted spray drying; in addition to the process optimization of the previously mentioned manufacturing methods. Furthermore, this review highlights using chitosan and its derivatives in primary nanoparticles preparation and as a polysaccharide to distribute the prepared nanoparticles in microparticles. Finally, this review discusses the factors affecting yield, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro aerosolization properties, size, morphological characters, in vitro release, and in vivo evaluation of inhalable chitosan nanocomposite microparticles.","Chitosan, Drug Carriers, Administration, Inhalation, Drug Delivery Systems, Nanocomposites",2023,Pharmaceutical nanotechnology
30563197,A Comprehensive Map of FDA-Approved Pharmaceutical Products.,"With the increasing research and development (R&amp;D) difficulty of new molecular entities (NMEs), novel drug delivery systems (DDSs) are attracting widespread attention. This review investigated the current distribution of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmaceutical products and evaluated the technical barrier for the entry of generic drugs and highlighted the success and failure of advanced drug delivery systems. According to the ratio of generic to new drugs and the four-quadrant classification scheme for evaluating the commercialization potential of DDSs, the results showed that the traditional dosage forms (e.g., conventional tablets, capsules and injections) with a lower technology barrier were easier to reproduce, while advanced drug delivery systems (e.g., inhalations and nanomedicines) with highly technical barriers had less competition and greater market potential. Our study provides a comprehensive insight into FDA-approved products and deep analysis of the technical barriers for advanced drug delivery systems.

33463063,Research trends in pharmacological modulation of tumor-associated macrophages.,"As one of the most abundant immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play important roles in multiple solid malignancies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. TAMs could contribute to carcinogenesis, neoangiogenesis, immune-suppressive TME remodeling, cancer chemoresistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Therefore, reprogramming of the immune-suppressive TAMs by pharmacological approaches has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. In this review, the promising pharmaceutical targets, as well as the existing modulatory strategies of TAMs were summarized. The chemokine-chemokine receptor signaling, tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, metabolic signaling, and exosomal signaling have been highlighted in determining the biological functions of TAMs. Besides, both preclinical research and clinical trials have suggested the chemokine-chemokine receptor blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, as well as the exosomal or nanoparticle-based targeting delivery systems as the promising pharmacological approaches for TAMs deletion or reprogramming. Lastly, the combined therapies of TAMs-targeting strategies with traditional treatments or immunotherapies as well as the exosome-like nanovesicles for cancer therapy are prospected.","Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Humans, Immunotherapy, Mice, Neoplasms, Tumor Microenvironment, Tumor-Associated Macrophages",2021,Clinical and translational medicine
24274298,Gold nanoparticle modified capacitive sensor platform for multiple marker detection.,"The detection and quantification of cancer biomarkers in human blood is crucial to diagnose patients in the early stage of a disease. The recent advances in biosensor technology can improve detection by reducing the application time and cost without an invasive approach. In this study, a highly sensitive, novel nanoparticle-modified capacitive sensor was developed for the detection of cancer markers. The current work mainly focused on developing a surface modification protocol for achieving higher sensitivity using Au-NPs. An interdigitated electrode (IDE) transducer was modified using gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) for signal enhancement, the platform was initially optimized with a small size IL-6 protein and the methodology was then applied for multiple marker detection with the aim of precise disease diagnostics. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (hEGFR) could be successfully detected in the concentration range of 20-1000 pg mL(-1) while cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) was detected in the range of 10-200 U mL(-1). These results show an increase of sensitivity by five-fold with respect to those not modified, demonstrating a highly sensitive and specific capacitive immunoassay that has a great potential for the use of early diagnosis of cancer disease.","Biomarkers, Tumor, Biosensing Techniques, Carcinoembryonic Antigen, Electrodes, ErbB Receptors, Gold, Humans, Immunoassay, Lung Neoplasms, Metal Nanoparticles, Mucin-1",2014,Talanta
39510241,Exploring quercetin's protective potential against the pro-inflammatory effects of silver nanoparticles in C57BL/6J mice.,"The increasing prevalence of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in various applications has sparked concerns about their potential adverse effects on human health. Hence, it is crucial to devise strategies to minimize their detrimental effects. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid present in human diet is known for its broad biological effects, including anti-inflammatory properties. Considering this, quercetin could serve as a promising strategy to protect the body against the harmful effects of AgNP. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the potential protective role of quercetin against the deleterious effects induced by 5Â nm polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-AgNP in C57BL/6J mice. Using a novel administration technology (HaPILLness), mice were given a daily oral dose of AgNP at 1Â mg/kg body weight (bw) or 10Â mg/kg bw for 14 days, combined with daily IP injections of quercetin at 1Â mg/kg bw. Our findings demonstrate that quercetin effectively attenuated the AgNP-induced intestinal inflammatory response, as demonstrated by reduced histological vascular and cellular alterations, along with a notable decrease in cytokine production, attributed to the inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-ÐºB inflammatory pathway. Quercetin's protective effects extended to the liver and lungs, by reversing changes in the inflammatory and antioxidant markers cluster of differentiation (CD)4, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase.","Animals, Quercetin, Silver, Metal Nanoparticles, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Male, Inflammation, Cytokines, Liver, Antioxidants, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, NF-kappa B, Oxidative Stress, Lung",2025,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association
39863194,Hyaluronic acid modified metal-organic frameworks loading cisplatin achieve combined chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy for lung cancer.,"As one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in clinical practice, cisplatin is unable to selectively accumulate in tumor tissue due to its lack of targeting ability, leading to increased systemic toxicities. Additionally, the effectiveness of monotherapy is greatly limited. Therefore, the development of new cisplatin-based drug delivery systems is essential to improve the effectiveness of tumor treatment. In this study, an iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) was synthesized to encapsulate cisplatin, and then coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) to create a MOF-based nanoplatform called MPt@HA NPs. This novel nanoplatform achieved the combination of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) with targeted chemotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer. The results showed that MPt@HA NPs have stronger cytotoxicity compared to conventional doses of cisplatin due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction and DNA damage caused by cisplatin. Therefore, MPt@HA NPs effectively inhibit the tumor growth and prolong the median survival of tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, the MOF-based nanoplatform MPt@HA NPs may present a new option for multi-modal therapy of solid tumors.","Hyaluronic Acid, Cisplatin, Metal-Organic Frameworks, Animals, Lung Neoplasms, Mice, Humans, Antineoplastic Agents, Reactive Oxygen Species, Cell Line, Tumor, Drug Carriers, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, A549 Cells, Nanoparticles",2025,International journal of biological macromolecules

32328850,Analysis of the susceptibility to COVID-19 in pregnancy and recommendations on potential drug screening.,"To analyze the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and the drugs that can be used to treat pregnancy with COVID-19, so as to provide evidence for drug selection in clinic. By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Antimalarials, Antiviral Agents, Basal Metabolism, Betacoronavirus, COVID-19, Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena, Chloroquine, Congenital Abnormalities, Coronavirus Infections, Disease Susceptibility, Drug Combinations, Drug Delivery Systems, Female, Functional Residual Capacity, Glycyrrhizic Acid, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Hypoglycemic Agents, Interferon Type I, Lopinavir, Metformin, Nanoparticles, Oxygen Consumption, Pandemics, Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A, Pneumonia, Viral, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Infectious, Progesterone, Prognosis, Respiratory Physiological Phenomena, Ritonavir, SARS-CoV-2, Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus, Stillbirth, Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio, COVID-19 Drug Treatment",2020,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology
16049491,Temporal targeting of tumour cells and neovasculature with a nanoscale delivery system.,"In the continuing search for effective treatments for cancer, the emerging model is the combination of traditional chemotherapy with anti-angiogenesis agents that inhibit blood vessel growth. However, the implementation of this strategy has faced two major obstacles. First, the long-term shutdown of tumour blood vessels by the anti-angiogenesis agent can prevent the tumour from receiving a therapeutic concentration of the chemotherapy agent. Second, inhibiting blood supply drives the intra-tumoural accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1-alpha); overexpression of HIF1-alpha is correlated with increased tumour invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. Here we report the disease-driven engineering of a drug delivery system, a 'nanocell', which overcomes these barriers unique to solid tumours. The nanocell comprises a nuclear nanoparticle within an extranuclear pegylated-lipid envelope, and is preferentially taken up by the tumour. The nanocell enables a temporal release of two drugs: the outer envelope first releases an anti-angiogenesis agent, causing a vascular shutdown; the inner nanoparticle, which is trapped inside the tumour, then releases a chemotherapy agent. This focal release within a tumour results in improved therapeutic index with reduced toxicity. The technology can be extended to additional agents, so as to target multiple signalling pathways or distinct tumour compartments, enabling the model of an 'integrative' approach in cancer therapy.","Angiogenesis Inhibitors, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Bibenzyls, Carcinoma, Lewis Lung, Coculture Techniques, Doxorubicin, Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Therapy, Combination, Endothelial Cells, Humans, Melanoma, Experimental, Mice, Nanotechnology, Neoplasms, Neovascularization, Pathologic, Stilbenes, Time Factors, Tissue Distribution",2005,Nature

While bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) demonstrate therapeutic potential through anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects, their age-related functional decline limits clinical utility. This study developed chitosan-functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs@CS, 100Â nm) to rejuvenate BMSCs through miR-20b-mediated selenoprotein biosynthesis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SeNPs@CS-treated BMSCs exhibited enhanced mitochondrial transfer capacity, delivering functional mitochondria to damaged alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) for cellular repair. Concurrently, miR-20b upregulation suppressed the RORÎ³t/STAT3/Th17 axis, reducing pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. The dual-target mechanism integrates immunomodulation via Th17 pathway inhibition with mitochondrial rejuvenation therapy, representing a paradigm-shifting approach for ALI management. These engineered BMSCs mitigated inflammatory markers in murine models, demonstrating superior efficacy to conventional BMSC therapies. Our findings establish SeNPs@CS-modified BMSCs as a novel therapeutic platform combining nanotechnology-enhanced stem cell engineering with precision immunometabolic regulation, providing new avenues for the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.","Animals, MicroRNAs, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Selenium, Mice, Th17 Cells, Mitochondria, Sepsis, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3, STAT3 Transcription Factor, Selenoproteins, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Nanoparticles, Acute Lung Injury, Male, Humans, Cell Differentiation, Chitosan",2025,Journal of nanobiotechnology

Informative and powerful evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress play a central role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Quercetin is well recognized for its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which showed great potential for ALI treatment. However, the application of quercetin is often hindered by its low solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, an inhalable quercetin-alginate nanogel (QU-Nanogel) was fabricated, and by this special ""material-drug"" structure, the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin were significantly enhanced, which could further increase the activity of quercetin and provide a promising therapy for ALI.","Acute Lung Injury, Alginates, Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Antioxidants, Inflammation, Nanogels, Particle Size, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Quercetin, Rats",2022,Journal of nanobiotechnology
39881299,CT-sensitized nanoprobe for effective early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.,"Early diagnosis is critical for providing a timely window for effective therapy in pulmonary fibrosis (PF); however, achieving this remains a significant challenge. The distinct honeycombing patterns observed in computed tomography (CT) for the primary diagnosis of PF are typically only visible in patients with moderate to severe disease, often leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we developed a nanoprobe designed to accumulate at fibroblastic foci and loaded with the CT sensitizer iodide to enable effective early diagnosis of PF. An antibody fragment (Fab') targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î±, which specifically binds to (myo)fibroblasts, was conjugated to the nanoprobe surface to enhance targeting of fibroblastic foci. Additionally, collagenase was employed to facilitate nanoprobe penetration by degrading the local collagen fibers within these foci. This approach led to significant accumulation of the CT sensitizer iodide in fibrotic lung tissues, resulting in enhanced CT imaging for the detection of fibroblastic foci and enabling early diagnosis of PF. Moreover, a dual-drug combination of oltipraz and rosiglitazone was co-loaded into the nanoparticles for the treatment of early-diagnosed PF. Remarkable therapeutic efficacy was observed in model mice with early PF using these nanoparticles. Our findings present a promising strategy for the early diagnosis of PF, potentially offering a valuable time window for effective treatment of this life-threatening disease.","Animals, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Mice, Early Diagnosis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Nanoparticles, Fibroblasts, Lung, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Humans, Male",2025,Journal of nanobiotechnology

Here we report a combined tumour-therapeutic modality based on integrating nanosonosensitizers-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. All components of the nanosonosensitizers (HMME/R837@Lip) are clinically approved, wherein liposomes act as carriers to co-encapsulate sonosensitizers (hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)) and immune adjuvant (imiquimod (R837)). Using multiple tumour models, we demonstrate that combining nanosonosensitizers-augmented SDT with anti-PD-L1 induces an anti-tumour response, which not only arrests primary tumour progression, but also prevents lung metastasis. Furthermore, the combined treatment strategy offers a long-term immunological memory function, which can protect against tumour rechallenge after elimination of the initial tumours. Therefore, this work represents a proof-of-concept combinatorial tumour therapeutics based on noninvasive tumours-therapeutic modality with immunotherapy.","Adjuvants, Immunologic, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, Apoptosis, B7-H1 Antigen, Cell Line, Tumor, Combined Modality Therapy, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, Female, Hematoporphyrins, Humans, Imiquimod, Immunotherapy, Liposomes, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Nanoparticles, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasms, Treatment Outcome, Ultrasonic Therapy",2019,Nature communications
38828798,"Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for Pulmonary Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals: A Review of Opportunities, Challenges, and Delivery Applications.","Biopharmaceuticals such as nucleic acids, proteins, and peptides constitute a new array of treatment modalities for chronic ailments. Invasive routes remain the mainstay of administering biopharmaceuticals due to their labile nature in the biological environment. However, it is not preferred for long-term therapy due to the lack of patient adherence and clinical suitability. Therefore, alternative routes of administration are sought to utilize novel biopharmaceutical therapies to their utmost potential. Nanoparticle-mediated pulmonary delivery of biologics can facilitate both local and systemic disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) afford many opportunities as pulmonary carriers due to their physicochemical stability and ability to incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, thus allowing novel combinatorial drug/gene therapies.

Here, we conjugated a single-chain antibody (scFv) targeting EGFR with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au nanoparticles to form an EGFR-specific molecular MRI bioprobe (scFv@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au) to better detect EGFR-positive NSCLC tumors in vivo. In vitro, we demonstrated that the EGFR-specific scFv could specifically deliver Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au to EGFR-positive NSCLC cells. In vivo experiments showed that the accumulation of scFv@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au in tumor tissue was detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the indicated time points after systemic injection. The T2W signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EGFR-positive SPC-A1 tumors was significantly decreased after scFv@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au injection, which was not observed in the tumors of mice injected with BSA@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed the specific localization of scFv@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Au in the SPC-A1 tumor cell cytoplasm.

29157272,Mechanistic insight into the impact of nanomaterials on asthma and allergic airway disease.,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease known for its high susceptibility to environmental exposure. Inadvertent inhalation of engineered or incidental nanomaterials is a concern for human health, particularly for those with underlying disease susceptibility. In this review we provide a comprehensive analysis of those studies focussed on safety assessment of different nanomaterials and their unique characteristics on asthma and allergic airway disease. These include in vivo and in vitro approaches as well as human and population studies. The weight of evidence presented supports a modifying role for nanomaterial exposure on established asthma as well as the development of the condition. Due to the variability in modelling approaches, nanomaterial characterisation and endpoints used for assessment in these studies, there is insufficient information for how one may assign relative hazard potential to individual nanoscale properties. New developments including the adoption of standardised models and focussed in vitro and in silico approaches have the potential to more reliably identify properties of concern through comparative analysis across robust and select testing systems. Importantly, key to refinement and choice of the most appropriate testing systems is a more complete understanding of how these materials may influence disease at the cellular and molecular level. Detailed mechanistic insight also brings with it opportunities to build important population and exposure susceptibilities into models. Ultimately, such approaches have the potential to more clearly extrapolate relevant toxicological information, which can be used to improve nanomaterial safety assessment for human disease susceptibility.","Air Pollutants, Animals, Asthma, Cytokines, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Inhalation Exposure, Lung, Nanostructures, Respiratory Hypersensitivity, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors",2017,Particle and fibre toxicology

New approaches to the treatment of lung cancer are urgently needed. Gene therapy has been widely proposed as a novel strategy to improve therapy. Although progress has been made using viral vectors, rapid advances in transfection technologies employing nonviral vectors, together with their relatively low toxicity, suggest that nonviral vectors may have significant potential for clinical applications. This paper briefly reviews general principles of gene delivery with emphasis on recent developments in the arena of lung cancer using nonviral vectors (naked DNA, polycationic polymers, cationic liposomes). Employing gene transfer techniques to achieve therapeutically useful levels of expression of therapeutic genes in the lung could provide a new strategy for treatment of lung cancer.","Animals, DNA, Drug Carriers, Excipients, Genetic Therapy, Genetic Vectors, Humans, Liposomes, Lung Neoplasms, Polymers",2007,Die Pharmazie

In the early 90s, TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), a cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily, attracted major interest in oncology owing to its selective anti-tumor properties. Clinical trials using soluble TRAIL or antibodies targeting the two main agonist receptors (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) have, however, failed to demonstrate their efficacy in the clinic. TRAIL is expressed on the surface of natural killer or CD8+ T activated cells and contributes to tumor surveillance. Nanoparticles functionalized with TRAIL mimic membrane-TRAIL and exhibit stronger antitumoral properties than soluble TRAIL or TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies. This review provides an update on the association and the use of nanoparticles associated with TRAIL for cancer therapy.","Apoptosis, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Humans, Killer Cells, Natural, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand",2017,Nanoscale
38941685,Combined drug anti-deep vein thrombosis therapy based on platelet membrane biomimetic targeting nanotechnology.,"After orthopedic surgeries, such as hip replacement, many patients are prone to developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which in severe cases can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism or major bleeding. Clinical intervention with high-dose anticoagulant therapy inevitably carries the risk of bleeding. Therefore, a targeted drug delivery system that adjusts local DVT lesions and potentially reduces drug dosage and toxic side effects important. In this study, we developed a targeted drug delivery platelet-derived nanoplatform (AMSNP@PM-rH/A) for DVT treatment that can simultaneously deliver a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) Recombinant Hirudin (rH), and the Factor Xa inhibitor Apixaban (A) by utilizing Aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AMSNP). This formulation exhibits improved biocompatibility and blood half-life and can effectively eliminate deep vein thrombosis lesions and achieve therapeutic effects at half the dosage. Furthermore, we employed various visualization techniques to capture the targeted accumulation and release of a platelet membrane (PM) coating in deep vein thrombosis and explored its potential targeting mechanism.","Venous Thrombosis, Blood Platelets, Pyridones, Animals, Humans, Hirudins, Pyrazoles, Nanoparticles, Drug Delivery Systems, Nanotechnology, Male, Silicon Dioxide, Biomimetic Materials, Mice, Cell Membrane, Recombinant Proteins, Factor Xa Inhibitors",2024,Biomaterials
