## Semi-Quantitative Scoring System for TCM-loaded Nanoparticles(maybe other medicine adopted too)
A comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) loaded nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery at first.
### overview
This repository contains the implementation of a semi-quantitative scoring system designed to evaluate TCM-loaded nanoparticles based on their physicochemical properties. 
The system provides a structured approach to assess the potential of nanoparticle formulations for pulmonary delivery applications. 
While the correlation between the scoring system and actual performance metrics (FPF/MMAD) was found to be non-linear, the framework serves as a valuable early screening tool for nanoparticle development.
